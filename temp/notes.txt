** FRONT END
- Redesign home page. I'm not satisfied with the look of the page on large screens.
- About page either needs content or needs to be excluded. Leaning towards exclusion at this point.
- Redesign the callout box on the equipment page for small screens. Looks wonky.
- Load real data onto equipment page from database.
- Need some javascript/regex to format phone number on the form input.
- Need to create a toast to pop up when a form is submitted to say: "Your message has been sent".
